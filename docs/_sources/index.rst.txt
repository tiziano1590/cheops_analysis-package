``cheope`` is an open-source fully bayesian code able to interpret 
light-curve datasets licensed under BSDv3. It runs using all the pycheops functionalities.

It allows to use CHEOPS, TESS and Kepler/K2 dataset using built-in function.
In alternative, one can use a owned ascii file with a light-curve and fit it
with cheope's ascii module.

``cheope`` can be easily modified thanks to its object-oriented structure. Can be expanded
and one day it will be conscious.



If you use ``cheope`` in you work, please see the guide to :ref:`citations`.
